# Hello World

This is the most basic example to come up with when developing a kernel.
I spent a long time trying to grasp as many mecanisms as possible (the 
compilation process, linking, inspecting object files, ... ) in order to have 
a decent understanding of the process, and I learned many things.

This directory is included only as an example.


## Comments

I recycled these files from a 2015 school lab. This is the reason why 
several files (which were given as a skeleton) are used 'as is', their
license/copyright headers are as a result kept intact. 

Also, some code is outdated, some parts are undocumented, and some
functions/variables are still in their original state (not clean at all). 

The code will be revisited gradually to keep the only strict minimum.
